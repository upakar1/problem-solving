# Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four
# of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated
# long integers.

# arr= [1,3,5,7,9]
# minimum sum = (1+3+5+7)
# maximum_sum = (3+5+7+9)
