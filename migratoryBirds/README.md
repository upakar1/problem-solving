# Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type id, determine the id of the most frequently sighted type. 
# If more than 1 type has been spotted that maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids.

# arr =[1,1,2,2,3]
#  here 1 and 2  occurs 2 time
#  in that case we look at the smallest id
